Data-driven methods such as Reinforcement Learning and Self-Supervised Learning have demonstrated an impressive ability to collect large amounts of data autonomously and enable robotic skill learning from the data collected. However, when these methods are successful, they tend to converge to either one or a handful of related task solutions, preventing robots from generalizing to more varied scenarios.

For example, consider the example below where the robot has learned to grasp the bowl. The robot has learned one solution that enables it to grasp the bowl when it is upright (left).
However, it is unable to grasp the bowl when it is flipped over (middle). By contrast, **humans are able to easily generalize** to this new situation by realizing that they can simply push the bowl to the edge of the table to flip the bowl over and then grasp it. This capacity to easily identify another solution in a novel task instance is enabled by diverse prior experience.

If robots learn from limited datasets and find only one way to do a task, they won't generalize to new situations, which humans are easily able to do.

What kind of data can help robots generalize?
-------------------------------------------------

To enable robots that truly generalize to new task instances, it is important to consider the ideal kinds of data that they should learn from. 


**Diversity**. The data should contain diverse behaviors that demonstrate different approaches to solving a task. In the example below, different strategies are used for placing the water bottle into the container. The robot might just be able to drop items into the container (left). At other times, it might need to stuff the water bottle into the container (middle). In some cases, stuffing the water bottle doesn't work, so the robot tips the bottle in (right). The robot _should learn from all of these strategies_ – it might need any one of them in a given situation.

{% endfigure %}

**Dexterity**. The data should contain instances of dexterous manipulation so that the robot can learn fine-grained manipulation behaviors. This is important for ensuring that the robot can actually _understand how to act_ in different scenarios. The example below shows the robot searching through the bin, replanning a grasp, and moving the object into a good position in order to grasp it.

<figcaption>
</figcaption>
{% endfigure %}

**Large-Scale**. Finally, there should be a large amount of data, so that the robot can learn from countless diverse situations and solutions to _generalize to a wide variety of settings_.

Collecting data to help robots generalize
-------------------------------------------------

There are several methods that have been used to collect robotic data in the past. Here, we evaluate the ability of each method to collect desirable data for generalization.

</video>
<figcaption>
Prior data collection methodologies include autonomous data collection (left), human supervision with web interfaces (middle), and human teleoperation with motion interfaces (right).
</figcaption>
{% endfigure %}

- **Autonomous Data Collection**: Many data collection mechanisms and algorithms such as Self-Supervised Learning[^SSL] and Deep Reinforcement Learning[^qtopt] use **random exploration** to collect their data. While this allows the robot to autonomously collect data, the data is strongly correlated and **lacks diversity**. This is because data is collected purely at random at first, and over time, methods converge to specific solution strategies.
<br>
- **Human Supervision with Web Interfaces**: By contrast, human supervision allows for direct specification of task solutions. Prior mechanisms[^roboflow] have allowed humans to leverage **graphical web interfaces** to guide robots through tasks. While such data collection schemes allow for diverse data to be collected at scale through humans, the interfaces **limit the dexterity** of the robot motions that can be demonstrated. For example, in the middle video above, a user has specified a program for the robot to execute, and the robot takes care of picking up the cups using simple top-down grasps. The human does not have much of a say in _how_ the task is done.  
<br>
- **Human Teleoperation with Motion Interfaces**: Others have developed **motion interfaces** to enable a direct one-to-one mapping between human motion and the end effector of the arm. One such example[^deep_imitation] is a person using a Virtual Reality headset and controller to guide the arm through a pick-and-place task. By offering users full control over how the arm accomplishes the task, these interfaces allow for data that is both diverse and dexterous. However, they **do not allow for large-scale data collection**, since the special hardware needed to develop such interfaces is not widely available.

{% endfigure %}

**Our goal was to develop a data collection mechanism that could simulataneously collect data that is diverse, dexterous, and that could be collected at scale.** To address these challenges, we developed <a href="http://roboturk.stanford.edu/">RoboTurk</a>.

RoboTurk
---------

<a href="http://roboturk.stanford.edu/">RoboTurk</a> is a platform that allows remote users to teleoperate simulated and real robots in real-time with only a smartphone and a web browser. Our platform supports many simultaneous users, each controlling their own robot remotely. **A new user can get started in less than 5 minutes** - all they need to do is download our smartphone application and go to our website, and they are ready to start collecting data.

### User Interface

Users receive a video stream of the robot workspace in their web browser and use their phone to guide the robot through a task. The motion of the phone is coupled to the motion of the robot, allowing for natural and dexterous control of the arm.

{% figure %}

</figcaption>
{% endfigure %}

We conducted a user study and showed that our user interface compares favorably with virtual reality controllers, which use special external tracking for the controllers, and significantly outperforms other interfaces such as a keyboard and a 3D mouse. This demonstrates that our user interface is both **natural** for humans to efficiently complete tasks and **scalable** to ensure that anyone with a smartphone can participate in data collection.

In our [first publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02790), we used RoboTurk to collect a <a href="http://roboturk.stanford.edu/dataset.html">Pilot Dataset</a> consisting of over 2000 task demonstrations in just 22 hours of total system usage. We also leveraged the demonstrations for policy learning and showed that using more demonstrations enables higher quality policies to be learned.

In summary, RoboTurk is able to collect data that exhibits properties for enabling robots to generalize:

- **Diversity**. RoboTurk can be used to collect _diverse_ data by leveraging many simultaneous human users for data collection.
<br>
- **Dexterity**. RoboTurk offers full 6-DoF control of the robot arm through a natural phone interface, allowing for _dexterity_ in the data.
<br>
- **Large-Scale**. RoboTurk allows for _large-scale_ data collection by allowing people to collect data from anywhere using just a smartphone and web browser. Our pilot dataset was collected in just 22 hours of system operation.

Data Collection and Tasks
---------

In our [initial publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02790), we used RoboTurk to collect a large dataset using robot manipulation tasks developed using [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org) and [robosuite](https://github.com/StanfordVL/robosuite). We then extended RoboTurk to enable data collection with physical robot arms, and used it to collect [the largest teleoperated robot manipulation dataset](http://roboturk.stanford.edu/realrobotdataset). 

{% figure %}
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/2019-10-07-roboturk/mandlekar_iros19.png"/>
<figcaption>
We collected data on three Sawyer robot arms - each of which had a front-facing webcam and a top-down Kinect depth camera mounted in the workspace of the robot arm.
</figcaption>
{% endfigure %}

The dataset consists of RGB images from a front-facing RGB camera (which is also the teleoperator video stream view) at 30Hz, RGB and Depth images from a top-down Kinectv2 sensor also at 30Hz, and robot sensor readings at 100Hz.

We collected our dataset using 54 different participants over the course of 1 week. Every user participated in a supervised hour of remote data collection, including a brief 5 minute tutorial at the beginning of the session. Afterwards, they were given the option to collect data without supervision for all subsequent collection. The users who participated in our data collection study collected the data from a variety of locations. All locations were remote - no data collection occurred in front of the actual robot arms.

### Tasks

{% figure %}
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/2019-10-07-roboturk/tasks.png"/>
<figcaption>
</figcaption>
{% endfigure %}

We designed three robotic manipulation tasks for data collection, shown above. These tasks were chosen with care in order to make sure that the data collected would be useful for robot generalization. Each task admits _diverse_ solution strategies, which encouraged our diverse set of users to experiment with different solution strategies, requires _dexterous_ manipulation to solve, and the robot needs to learn to _generalize_ to several scenarios. We also note that the tasks would be incredibly difficult to simulate, making physical data collection necessary.

- **Object Search**. The goal of this task is to search for a set of target objects within a cluttered bin and fit them into a specific box. There are three target object categories: _plush animals_, _plastic water bottles_, and _paper napkins_. A target category is randomly selected and relayed to the operator, who must use the robot arm to find all three objects corresponding to the target category and place each item into its corresponding hole. This task requires **precise manipulation** due to the bin containing many rigid and deformable objects in clutter, the need to search for hidden objects, and tight object placement.
<!-- The objects also have interesting properties - the paper napkins appear in crumpled and unfolded configurations, and the crushed plastic water bottles are challenging to detect and grasp due to their translucence and arbitrary rigid shape. -->

{% endfigure %}

- **Tower Creation**. In this task, an assortment of cups and bowls are arranged on the table. The goal of the task is to create the tallest tower possible by stacking the cups and bowls on top of each other. This task requires **physical reasoning**: operators must use a geometric understanding of objects and dexterous placement to carefully craft their towers while maintaining tower stability.

{% endfigure %}

- **Laundry Layout**. This task starts with a hand towel, a pair of jeans, or a t-shirt placed on the table. The goal is to use the robot arm to straighten the item so that it lies flat on the table with no folds. On every task reset we randomly place the item into a new configuration. This task requires **generalization** over several different item configurations.

<figcaption>
</figcaption>
{% endfigure %}

We collected over 111 hours of total robot manipulation data in just 1 week across 54 users on our 3 manipulation tasks, with over 2000 successful demonstrations in total. This makes our dataset 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than most other datasets in terms of interaction time. The number of task demonstrations in our dataset also compares favorably with the number of demonstrations in large datasets such as [MIME](https://sites.google.com/view/mimedataset)[^MIME], but the tasks that we collected data on are more difficult to complete, as they take on the order of minutes to complete successfully, as opposed to seconds. Some other notable datasets collected by humans include [DAML](https://sites.google.com/view/daml)[^DAML], [Deep Imitation](https://sites.google.com/view/vrlfd)[^deep_imitation], and [JIGSAWS](https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/research/hmm/datasets/jigsaws_release/)[^JIGSAWS].

Platform Evaluation
---------

### Diverse Solution Strategies

On the _Tower Creation_ task, **our users surprised us by building intricate structures out of the simple sets of cups and bowls**. We also saw a great deal of diversity in the towers that people chose to build. 

{% figure %}
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/2019-10-07-roboturk/diversity_transition.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
{% endfigure %}

Some **notable emergent solution strategies** that were observed include building an inverted cone and alternating cups and bowls for stability, as well as flipping over a bowl for the base of the tower and grouping 3 cups together to form a stable platform. In particular, we had no idea that it was even possible to control the robot to flip a bowl over - it truly speaks to the power of human creativity coupled with the dexterity that the interface enables.

The users themselves were diverse - their skill levels varied significantly. This can be seen from the large variation in average task completion time per user on the _Object Search_ and _Laundry Layout_ tasks in the plot below. **User variation naturally emerges from collecting across 54 different people and ensures data diversity.** Note that most users were determined to use all 5 of their allotted minutes for the _Tower Creation_ task.

### Diverse and Dexterous Manipulation in the Dataset

Next, we present some qualitative examples of diverse and dexterous behaviors in the _Object Search_ task.

In the examples below, the operators used the arm to manipulate the plastic water bottle into a favorable place in order to grasp it successfully.

### Scaling to New Users

All 54 of our users were new, non-expert users. We found that **users with no experience started generating useful data in a matter of minutes.** 
- On _Object Search_, new users were able to successfully pick and place a target object for the first time within 2 minutes of interaction time on average. 
- On _Laundry Layout_, new users were able to successfully layout their first towel in less than 4 minutes of interaction on average. 

This corroborates the results of our user exit survey - **a majority (60.8%) of users reported that they felt comfortable using the system within 15 minutes**, while 96% felt comfortable within an hour.

Furthermore, we witnessed **significant user improvement over time**. As shown below, users learned to complete the task more efficiently over time as they collected more demonstrations. Furthermore, users moved the orientation of the phone more with increasing experience, suggesting that they learned to leverage full 6-DoF control to generate dexterous task solutions of increasing quality.

Leveraging the Dataset
----------

We provide some examples applications for our dataset. However, we emphasize that our dataset can be useful for several other applications as well, such as multimodal density estimation, policy learning, and hierarchical task planning. 

### Reward Learning

Consider the problem of learning a policy to imitate a specific video demonstration. Prior work has approached this problem by learning an embedding space over visual observations and then crafting a reward function to imitate a reference trajectory based on distances in the embedding space. This reward function can then be used with reinforcement learning to learn a policy that imitates the trajectory. Taking inspiration from this approach, we trained a modified version of [Time Contrastive Networks](https://sermanet.github.io/tcn/) (TCN)[^TCN] on Laundry Layout demonstrations and investigate some interesting properties of the embedding space.

<figcaption>
Learned embedding distances to a desired target frame provide a meaningful reward function for imitation learning as well as a useful metric for task progress.

{% endfigure %}

In the figure above, we consider the frame embeddings along a single _Laundry Layout_ demonstration. We plot the negative L2 distance of the frame embeddings with respect to the embedding of a target frame near the end of the video, where the target frame depicts a successful task completion with the towel lying flat on the table. The figure demonstrates that distances in this embedding space with a suitable target frame yield a reasonable reward function that could be used to imitate task demonstrations purely from visual observations. 

Furthermore, embedding distances capture task semantics to a certain degree and could even be used to measure task progress. For example, in frames 3 and 5, the towel is nearly flat on the table, and the embedding distance to frame 6 is correspondingly small. By contrast, in frames 2 and 4, the robot is holding the towel a significant distance away from the table, and the distance to frame 6 is correspondingly large.

### Video Prediction

### Behavioral Cloning

To demonstrate that the data collected by our platform can be used for policy learning, we leveraged a small subset of data to train a policy on a restricted _Laundry Layout_ task instance using behavioral cloning. The trained policy is shown below.

<!-- However, our attempts to learn a policy from the entire dataset were ultimately unsuccessful due to the diverse nature of the demonstrations - addressing the diversity of the dataset for policy learning is left for future work. -->

Summary
----------

- RoboTurk is the first robot data collection platform that allows for collecting robot manipulation data that has _diversity_, _dexterity_, and is _large-scale_, which are all critical properties to enable robots that can generalize to new situations.
<br>
- We introduce three challenging manipulation tasks: _Object Search_, _Tower Creation_, and _Laundry Layout_. These tasks admit diverse solutions and strategies and require dexterous manipulation to solve. Significant generalization capability is also required for robots to solve these tasks due to the large variation in task instance.
<br>
- We present the [largest known crowdsourced teleoperated robot manipulation dataset](http://roboturk.stanford.edu/realrobotdataset) consisting of over 111 hours of data across 54 users. The dataset was collected in 1 week on 3 Sawyer robot arms using the RoboTurk platform. We made important extensions to the RoboTurk platform to enable data collection on physical robots, including accounting for additional delays in the remote teleoperation loop due to physical robot actuation, ensuring operational safety of the robots when being controlled by novices, and managing large-scale data collection across multiple sensor streams.
<br>
- We evalaute our platform and show that it can scale easily to new users, that the data collected consists of diverse and dexterous task solutions, and that the dataset has several applications such as multimodal density estimation, video prediction, reward function learning, policy learning and hierarchical task planning.
